Inspired by the famous battle of Peter Norving and Ron Jeffries
I'm attempting to write a sudoku solver relying solely on test driven development.
I do this first and foremost as a fun challenge,
but also because both sides seems to agree that while TDD can be useful in certain cases,
it's abolutely [not an algorithm generator](http://vladimirlevin.blogspot.com/2007/04/tdd-is-not-algorithm-generator.html).
I want to prove everyone wrong, just to annoy them ¯\_(ツ)_/¯.
